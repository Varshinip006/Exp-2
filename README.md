# Exp - 2 LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To draw UML diagrams for Library Management System

# SRS (Procedure):

## Step 1: Problem Identification

Manual library operations like issuing, returning, and tracking books are time-consuming and prone to errors. The system aims to automate these processes.

## Step 2: Requirement Analysis

Identify user roles: Admin, Librarian, Student.      
Define main functions: Add books, issue/return books, search books, manage members, generate reports.     
Set non-functional needs: reliability, security, and easy interface.    

## Step 3: System Design

Draw UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, and Package diagrams.      
Design database tables for Books, Members, Transactions, and Staff.
